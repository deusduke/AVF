            Twitter could be use for login with open auth.  This would allow application developers to rely on Twitter accounts already made and allows the user to not have to remember another user name and password.  For payments, the same thing could be done as far as accounts and logins.  There has also been a few "pay with tweet" services popping up recently but Twitter is starting to crack down on these service.

            I thought JSON-P was not very useful at all, until they went into the cross-domain possibilities.  Cross domain scripting is extremely useful at times but is usually blocked by the browser.  By allowing the client to execute a callback it looks like the JSON-P would allow the client to access data from a different domain.  This would actually be pretty useful at work!
            <br><br>
            Using JSON-P, you could store data locally on the device using system storage, for instance caching requests from twitter or Facebook.

            I plan on using a dark, professional looking them similar to what you might see in many of todays professional applications like PS or Unity 3D.  Users will be able to take and store pictures to be used as thumbnails for their projects, and well as review items and information about a given project.  If possible, it would be cool to have an alarm feature that would go off as a reminder when the project is close to being due.

            Probably the biggest lesson that I've learned as a developer is to prevent scope creep as much as possible.  This has plagued many project that I have worked on and a lot of them did not make it to completion.  Now I try my best to declare the boundaries and extents of a project up front to the best of my ability to ensure success and hit my targets.
