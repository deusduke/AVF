            I think that the main thing that I could do for my app to increase accessibilty is to add the alt tags to the images.  This would allow screen readers to at least read the context of what the image contains.  Also this would help with SEO rankings by adding more keywords to my sites categorization, that is if the site were to be deployed to the web.
            <br><br>
            The most common support mechanisms that I saw when looking at review videos for mobile accessibility was the voice over options.  The help users by reading aloud the different areas of an application.  I think that we as developers could make better use of this by being sure to use text for things like buttons and logos as this would allow the screen ready to let the user know what is available to the visually impaired users.  If images are used for thing like buttons, there are options available via the Android and iOS api's that allow for adding a description to what this are of the application is to be used for.  This is read aloud by the screen ready and helps with the end user understanding the application.

            One obvious device that helps with accessibility is the wheelchair.  This helps people that have lost the ability to walk to get around with their arms, or sometimes even via a lever if the wheelchair is motorized.  Another could be the more recent personal emergency response systems.  These devices are used for general responses catered to an individuals risk factors, like falling or the temperature falling to low.
            <br><br>
            One app that is built on Android specifically for mobile accessibility is the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.codefactory.android.app.ma.vocalizerenudemo&hl=en">Mobile Accessibility Demo US</a>.  This is an app that is available on Android is pretty interesting.  It allows the user to slide their finger along the screen and when they get above a button it reads the button allowed to them.  They can then make selections after being given speech cues they allow them to perform basic phone functions like make phone calls, send emails, go through contacts, etc.

            Another app is called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.revolucian.enliven&hl=en">Free Colorblind Aid</a>.  This app is more geared towards designers but it allows them to see what their colorblind users would see.  This is useful so that they can test with that multiple blindness modes.
